*An animated demo showcasing real-time detection of human, fire, and emotion recognition.* 

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a web service developed using **FastAPI** for a variety of detection and recognition tasks. The service features a user-friendly interface that allows for seamless image and video uploads. The backend employs advanced models to perform real-time analysis and detection for tasks such as:

- 🙂 **Facial emotion recognition**
- 🧍 **Human detection**
- 🔥 **Fire detection**
- 🔫 **Gun detection**
- 💨 **Smoke detection**
- 🔪 **Knife detection**
- 👊 **Fight detection**

Future updates will also integrate **text** and **speech recognition** capabilities.
